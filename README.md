Geographical Calculator was developed for laravel 5.8+ to help you to implement geographical calculation,
with With several algorithms that help you deal with coordinates.

Installation
------------

##### 1 - Dependency

The first step is using composer to install the package and automatically update your composer.json file, you can do this by running:

```shell
composer require diamonddev/laravel-geographical-calculator
```

##### 2 - Copy the package providers to your local config with the publish command, this will publish the config:

```shell

php artisan geo:install

```

    | "2-3" => ["km" => "some result"],
    | "3-4" => ["km" => "some result"],
    | and if you want to set any prefix before each index
    | you must change the below value to any value you want.
    |
